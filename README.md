## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a quiz game that presents multiple-choice questions to the user. The game should keep track of the user's score and provide feedback based on their answers.

## Key Components
1. **User Interface:**
   - Design a user-friendly interface to display questions one at a time.
   - Provide multiple-choice options (e.g., A, B, C) for each question.

2. **Question Data:**
   - Store quiz questions and answer choices in a data structure (e.g., an array or dictionary).
   - Associate each question with the correct answer.

3. **Scoring System:**
   - Initialize a score variable to track correct answers.
   - Increment the score when the user selects the correct answer.

4. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - After each question, provide feedback:
     - If the user's answer is correct, display a positive message.
     - If the answer is incorrect, show the correct answer.

5. **End of Quiz:**
   - Display the user's total score once all questions are answered.
   - Consider adding a "Play Again" option.
